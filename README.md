# Master-Thesis: Carbon Footprints of European Central Bank (ECB)

The market-neutral approach followed by the European Central Bank (ECB) for its asset portfolio undermines the EU goal of transitioning to a low carbon economy. This
thesis investigates the extent of carbon emissions taken into account while purchasing bonds to suggest greener pathways. 
The thesis is divided into two parts: 
a) Creating database for Corporate Bond Purchases Program (CSPP) holdings, industry classification, revenue and emissions information.
b) Estimating the carbon intensity using different metrics.
